# dotfiles
Dotfiles and Powershell scripts to setup a new desktop and to automate tasks

## Repository structure
Todo.txt - contains rough notes on what I have to implement\
NOTES.MD - contains reference notes regarding implementation of the scripts

## Thanks to the Heroes

I stole scripts from these people whenever I was too lazy to code and Googled them first, because why code if someone has already done it? (jk this is basically how learning works, and I do learn something new from their code instead of blindly copying them)
