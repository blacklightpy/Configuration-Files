# dotfiles
Dotfiles and shell scripts to setup a new desktop and to automate tasks.

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are basically configuration files for various applications like desktop themes, VS Code themes, launch options, etc. These files are usually kept as hidden files in /home folder in Linux, so they are referred to as dotfiles since . prefix is used to hide a file.

This repository contains dotfiles and some scripts used to automate mundane tasks like installing your favorite apps after reinstalling an OS, loading dotfiles, etc.

## Thanks to the Heroes

I stole ideas and scripts from these people whenever I was too lazy to code by Googled for them first, because why code manually if someone has already done it? (jk this is basically how learning works, and I do learn something new from their code instead of blindly copying them)
